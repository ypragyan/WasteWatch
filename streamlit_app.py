Initially, Conv2D layers with 128 filters process the input image, followed by batch normalization for model stability. Max-pooling reduces spatial dimensions, and dropout helps prevent overfitting. The architecture repeats with 128 filters. The Global Average Pooling 2D layer averages spatial dimensions, and Dense layers shape the final output. In this model, there are 6 output units, for classifying the input image into 6 types of waste.")

It utilizes the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-3 and is compiled with the Categorical Cross Entropy loss function. To enhance training, a ReduceLROnPlateau callback is employed, which dynamically adjusts the learning rate based on the validation loss, allowing for more efficient convergence. The training process involves 50 epochs, and the model's performance metrics, such as accuracy, are monitored. The training history, including information about the loss and accuracy during each epoch, is stored in the 'history' variable for further analysis.")

Accuracy, representing overall correctness, can be misleading in imbalanced datasets, where it may not reflect performance on the minority class. Precision, assessing positive prediction accuracy, is vital when the cost of false positives is significant, as seen in spam email detection. F1 Score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, offers a balanced evaluation, particularly beneficial when there's an uneven class distribution and consideration of both false positives and false negatives is essential.")

With an accuracy this high, our model is ready to be deployed in waste management facilities.")
